# Further resources

The following are resources that I've found useful in learning more about analytics, both in basketball and 
more generally. I've linked to Amazon for books for convenience, but I have no affiliation with them.

## Books

### Basketball Focused

- [Basketball on Paper](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Basketball-Paper-Rules-Performance-Analysis/dp/1574886886) by Dean Oliver. Regarded by many as the book that started the analytics revolution in basketball. While shot and data tracking has moved on from the paper-based method presented, the core ideas are still incredibly important.
- [How to Watch Basketball Like a Genius](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Watch-Basketball-Like-Genius-Astrophysicists/dp/1419744801) by Nick Greene. Not strictly an analytics book, but great insights into the game and how it is played.
- [Sprawlball](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sprawlball-Visual-Tour-New-Era/dp/1328767515) by Kirk Goldsberry. Fantastic visualisation and analysis of shot data and how it has changed the NBA.
- [The Midrange Theory](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Midrange-Theory-Seth-Partnow/dp/1629379212) by Seth Partnow. I consider this book a bit of a "mythbuster" when it comes to analytics, amongst other things making a case for why the midrange shot is still an important part of the game.

### Non-Basketball

- [Making decisions](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Making-Decisions-brilliant-smart-thinking-leadership/dp/0008530149/ref=asc_df_0008530149/) by Ed Smith. A book on using data in making decisions by an ex-England cricket selector.
